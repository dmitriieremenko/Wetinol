                The Company reserves the right to amend the provisions of the Cooperation Terms unilaterally (to the extent relevant to the subject matter of the Agreement and the Cooperation Terms). The Company may, at its sole discretion (but is not obliged to), notify the Subcontractor of the amendments of the Cooperation Terms. Any amendments of the Cooperation Terms are legally binding for the Subcontractor; in case the Subcontractor objects to any amendments of the Cooperation Terms, he/she shall immediately terminate the Engagement and perform all relevant actions as may be required in connection with the termination of the Engagement.</p>

            <p>
                4.16.&nbsp;Without prejudice to the immediately preceding clause, to the extent that an applicable mandatory rule of the law requires the amount of IP Remuneration to be expressly determined, such remuneration shall, for the purposes of that rule only, be deemed to be the higher of:</p>
            <p>
                (a)&nbsp;the minimum amount of such remuneration required by any mandatory rules of applicable law (if any);</p>

The Subcontractor confirms that the IP Remuneration is adequate, and no other remuneration for the Relevant IP Rights or the Relevant IP Objects shall be due or payable to the Subcontractor. To the maximum extent allowed under applicable law, the Subcontractor waives any right it may have to challenge the assignment of the Relevant IP Rights to the Company, or the effect of any other provisions of the Agreement or the Cooperation Terms, by reason of any failure on the part of the Company to pay the said remuneration.</p>
            <p>
                4.17. If, apart from this clause, the assignment of the Relevant IP Rights and the Relevant IP Objects to the Company would be unenforceable in full or in part, but the application of this clause would make it enforceable, then this clause shall apply. In such case, the amount of remuneration in respect of Relevant IP Rights created in a given calendar month shall, for the purposes of the rule of the law referred to in clause 4.16 only, be deemed to be 1% (one per cent) of the Fees (exclusive of IP Remuneration) agreed to be payable for Services rendered in that calendar month (and the amount of Fees agreed to be payable for Services shall be deemed to be equal to the amounts actually paid minus the relevant IP Remuneration, unless other amounts of Fees that are expressly exclusive of IP Remuneration are agreed by the Parties in writing).</p>

Субпідрядник підтверджує, що така винагорода за Відповідні Права ІВ є достатньою, і жодна інша винагорода за Відповідні Права ІВ або Відповідні Об&#39;єкти ІВ не підлягає сплаті Субпідряднику.

                <p>
                    4.17.&nbsp; Якщо незастосування цього пункту призвело б до повної чи часткової неможливості примусового виконання передачі Відповідних Прав ІВ або Відповідних Об&#39;єктів ІВ Компанії, застосовується цей пункт. В такому випадку, розмір винагороди за Відповідні Права ІВ, створені у певному календарному місяці, вважатиметься лише для цілей положення закону, вказаного в пункті 4.16, таким, що становить 1% від загального розміру Винагороди, що погоджений Сторонами як такий, що підлягає сплаті за Послуги, надані в такому місяці (не враховуючи Винагороду за Права ІВ) (і при цьому розмір Винагороди за Послуги вважатиметься таким, що дорівнює сумам, що були фактично сплачені, мінус розмір Винагороди за ІВ, окрім випадків, коли Сторони прямо і в письмовій формі погодили інший розмір Винагороди, прямо зазначивши, що такий розмір винагороди не включає Винагороду за ІВ).</p>
